## Features

### Game Mechanics
- Turn-Based Gameplay:
	- The game operates on a turn-based system, alternating between the player's turn and the monsters' turn.
- Attack Roll:
	- To initiate an attack, the attacker rolls a d20 (20-sided die).
	- The result is compared to the target's Armor Class (AC).
	- If the roll is equal to or higher than the AC, the attack is successful.
- Damage Roll:
	- Once an attack hits, the damage is determined by rolling the attacker's damage dice.
	- For example, the player uses one d10 (10-sided die), while the Skeleton Mage has four d4's (four 4-sided dice).
	- The total damage is calculated by adding the result of the damage dice roll to the attacker's 'plsDmg' value.
- Critical Hits:
	- A roll of 20 on the Attack Roll is considered a critical hit.
	- In a critical hit, the number of damage dice is doubled.
	- For instance, the player would roll two d10's instead of one, and the Skeleton Mage would roll eigth d4's instead of four.
- Healing:
	- Similar to the Attack Roll, Healing is determinated by a roll of a d20.
	- The result is then added to the players Health Points (HP).
### Start Screen
![Start Screen](readme-images/start-screen.webp)
The game starts with a short description on how the game works. Here the player has the option to start the game.
### Player Card
![Player Card](readme-images/player-card.webp)
This is the player character, besides a visual representation of the player, this is where the player's health and armor are shown.
### Monster Cards
![Monster cards](readme-images/monsters.webp)
There are 8 different monster encounters, all with a unique design and different strengths/weaknesses.
### Ability Buttons
![Ability Buttons](readme-images/player-buttons.webp)
During the player's turn they have two options, either to attack the monster or drink a healing potion to regain some health points.
### Rolling the dice
![Hit](readme-images/hit.webp)
The effect of any action is decided by the roll of a dice. Will the attack hit? How much damage will it do?
### Sound Effects
![Sound Effects](readme-images/sound-effects.webp)
All effects have a unique sound effect in the style of an old-school RPG. In the top left corner of the screen, there is a Toggle-switch to mute/unmute the sound. The icons for the switch are designed to be discrete but still be visible for the user.
### Game Over
![Game Over](readme-images/game-over.webp)
When the player's health reaches 0, the game is over. Here the collected points are shown and the current high score. The user also has the option to restart the game.

## Development
### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from [Dice Roll Game](https://codingscape.info/how-to-create-dice-roll-game-using-javascript/), but since I've been spending way too many hours in Baldurs Gate 3 lately, I wanted something involving a d20 dice. I also wanted to incorporate fantasy characters in the style of old-school RPG's into the game. The game should be turned-based where the player has time to think about their next move, but feel the tension of a dice roll to decide the outcome of that move. 
### Prototyping
The game foundation was started by sketching a layout in Balsamiq Wireframes where the idea evolved into making it a card game of sorts, think Magic: The Gathering but with fewer cards. The main focus of the UI is the cards of the player and the monster.
![Wireframes](readme-images/wireframes.png)\
After a layout was decided, the basics were created with HTML and CSS to make a working prototype with a 'mobile-first' thought process. Making sure the game area fits into a small mobile screen. 
![Alpha Stage](readme-images/alpha-stage.webp)\
Once the site started to look like the wireframe layout, work began on the JavaScript where the main focus was on getting the basic gameplay to work, inspiration for the game rules came from [D&D BASIC RULES](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). To make sure the game mechanics worked as intended, work relied heavily on console logs to output what was happening under the hood.
![Console Outputs](readme-images/console.webp)
### Look and Feel
To add visual feedback to the game, animations were created with tabletop cards in mind, but also how battles in old RPG's work. With this in mind and to save screen real estate, the card-flip animation was created, this creates a natural space where the d20 roll animation could be shown to the player. The damage animation was created to make the attack animation feel like it has impact. 

The visual theme of the cards continues in the theme of old-school RPGs where the graphical assets are pixelated and the reason why the retro-styled fonts (DotGothic16 and VT323) were selected.

To address the visual monotony that a one-color background might present, especially on larger screens, a play board-styled background image was added. The card frames and buttons are custom-designed to match the aesthetic of the background.

To add further to the user experience, sound effects were added, following the theme of old-school RPG's. The files were converted from .wav to .mp3 to save space, which saved about 5,3MB.

### Color codes
Colors were selected using [Coolors](https://coolors.co), matching them with the main colors of the background image and the background color. Every monster have a unique background color to difference them more than just their graphic image.

### Bugs
<details><summary>Bug: No new monster is picked after the player defeats the current one</summary>

This was fixed by creating a function to make a copy of the randomly selected monster.
```js
currentMonster = copyMonster(selectRandomMonster());
/**
* Copies the stats from a monster in the monster array
* @param {*} monster
* @returns
*/
function copyMonster(monster) {
return Object.assign({}, monster);
}
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: The player can make multiple attacks in one turn by pressing the attack button twice</summary>

The EventListener for the attack button was in the `gameLoop()` function, but the EventListener was never disabled, making it possible to press the button in quick succession to run the `playerTurn()` function multiple times.
To fix this I moved the EventListener from the `gameLoop()`:
```js
if (isPlayerTurn) {
	 // It's the player's turn
	 // Wait for the player to take it's action
	 let playerActionBtn = document.getElementById('attack');
	 playerActionBtn.addEventListener('click', playerTurn);
	 }
```
To the `playerTurn()`function, where the EventListener is removed when the user presses the button
```js
async function playerTurn() {
	 // Prevent the button to be pressed several times
	 function onPlayerActionClick() {
		 playerActionBtn.removeEventListener('click', onPlayerActionClick);
		 playerAttack();
	 }
	 // Listener for attack button
	 let playerActionBtn = document.getElementById('attack');
	 playerActionBtn.addEventListener('click', onPlayerActionClick);
 }
 The old `playerTurn()`function was renamed to `PlayerAttack()`
```

</details>
<details> <summary>Bug: Damage rolls are higher than intended</summary>

In the `rollForDamage()`function, the number of hit dices are looped to ensure the case where more than 1 hit dice is used. However, there was a typo that caused the loop to roll 1 extra dice.
```js
for (let i=0; i <= creature.numDices; i++) {
		 damage += creature.hitDice + creature.plusDmg;
	 }
```
This was fixed by fixes the typo.
```js
  for (let i=0; i < creature.numDices; i++) {
		 damage += creature.hitDice + creature.plusDmg;
	 }
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Monsters damage is miscalculated</summary>

There was a typo in the `monsterTurn()`function.
This added the players toHit value to the monsters attack.
```js
let attackRoll = diceRoll + player.toHit;
```
This was fixed with:
```js
let attackRoll = diceRoll + currentMonster.toHit;
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Damage is not calculated correctly</summary>

This bug was caused when I tried to clean up the code.
In commit `7330400` I changed the hitDice value in both the player and monster array from:
```js
const player = {
	...
	hitDice: d10,
	...
}
const monsters = {
	...
	hitDice: d6,
	...
	hitDice: d12,
}
function rollForDamage(creature, crit) {
	...
	damage += creature.hitDice() + creature.plusDmg;
	...
}
```
to:
```js
const player = {
	...
	hitDice: d10(),
	...
}
const monsters = {
	...
	hitDice: d6(),
	...
	hitDice: d12(),
}
function rollForDamage(creature, crit) {
	...
	damage += creature.hitDice + creature.plusDmg;
	...
}
```
This caused the hitdice functions to be run only once at the start of the game and not be a random number for each roll as intended. The solution was to revert the changes.

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Start button could not be pressed in Safari</summary>

This bug only occured in MacOS Safari, the original plan was to have the Start button flip together with the player card, like it was a part of it. However in testing I realised that only one half of the button was clickable. This has something with how Safari interperrets the `transform-style: preserve-3d;` in CSS, I could not fix it without moving the Start button from the player-card div to the btn-area div (where it logically belongs). However after that I struggled with getting the button flip animation to work smoothly with the card, I eventually settled with creating a fade animation for the button.
```css
.button-fade {
	animation: buttonFade ease 1s;
}
@keyframes buttonFade {
	0% { opacity: 0; }
	100% { opacity: 1; }
}
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Hit misses when rolled equal to AC</summary>

When attack roll is equal to the target AC it should hit. A typo in the JS caused it to miss.
```js
if ((attackRoll > currentMonster.armorClass) || (crit)) {...}
if ((attackRoll > player.armorClass) || (crit)) {...}
```
was changed to:
```js
if ((attackRoll >= currentMonster.armorClass) || (crit)) {...}
if ((attackRoll >= player.armorClass) || (crit)) {...}
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Sound effects does not work in Safari</summary>

Turns out that Safari does not support .ogg files. This was fixed by converting the original .wav files to .mp3

</details>


### Known Bugs
<details><summary>Bug: Sometimes sound effects aren't playing on iOS Safari</summary>

Sometimes the sound effect does not play in iOS Safari, seems to happen randomly. It did not occur to me on any other browser, and I have not been able to understand why it happens.

</details>

No known bugs remaining.\
