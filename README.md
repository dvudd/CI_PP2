## Features
### Game Mechanics
Turn-Based Gameplay: The game operates on a turn-based system, alternating between the player's turn and the monsters' turn.
Attack Roll:
- To initiate an attack, the attacker rolls a d20 (20-sided die).
- The result is compared to the target's Armor Class (AC).
- If the roll is equal to or higher than the AC, the attack is successful.
Damage Roll:
- Once an attack hits, the damage is determined by rolling the attacker's damage dice.
- For example, the player uses one d10 (10-sided die), while the Skeleton Mage has four d4's (four 4-sided dice).
- The total damage is calculated by adding the result of the damage dice roll to the attacker's 'plsDmg' value.
Critical Hits:
- A roll of 20 on the Attack Roll is considered a critical hit.
- In a critical hit, the number of damage dice is doubled.
- For instance, the player would roll two d10's instead of one, and the Skeleton Mage would roll eigth d4's instead of four.
### Start Screen
The game starts with a short description of how the game works.
### Player Card
This is the player character, besides a visual representation of the player, this is where the player's health and armor are shown.
### Monster Cards
There are 8 different monster encounters, all with different strengths and weaknesses.
### Ability Buttons
During the player's turn they have two options, either attack the monster or drink a healing potion to regain some health points.
### Rolling the dice
The effect of any action is decided by the roll of a dice. Will the attack hit? How much damage will it do?
### Game Over
When the player's health reaches 0, the game is over. Here the collected score is shown, and the user has the option to restart the game.
## Future Features
While the game is fully functional, there are many ways to improve the experience
- Sound effects
- Selectable characters, example:
	- A Fighter with high defense but medium damage
	- A Thief with a chance to dodge incoming damage
	- A Wizard with low defense but high damage spells
- More player abilities, with different cooldowns.
- Equipable items that the player can find along the way
	- Better weapons
	- Better armor
	- Better healing potions
- More monsters
- Boss battles!
## Development
### Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from [Dice Roll Game](https://codingscape.info/how-to-create-dice-roll-game-using-javascript/), but since I've been spending way too many hours in Baldurs Gate 3 lately, I wanted something involving a d20 dice. I also wanted to incorporate fantasy characters in the style of old-school RPG's into the game. The game should be turned-based where the player has time to think about their next move, but feel the tension of a dice roll to decide the outcome of that move. 
### Prototyping
The game foundation was started by sketching a layout in Balsamiq Wireframes where the idea evolved into making it a card game of sorts, think Magic: The Gathering but with fewer cards. The main focus of the UI is the cards of the player and the monster.
![Wireframes](readme-images/wireframes.png)\
After a layout was decided, the basics were created with HTML and CSS to make a working prototype with a 'mobile-first' thought process. Making sure the game area fits into a small mobile screen. 
![Alpha Stage](readme-images/alpha-stage.webp)\
Once the site started to look like the wireframe layout, work began on the JavaScript where the main focus was on getting the basic gameplay to work, inspiration for the game rules came from [D&D BASIC RULES](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf). To make sure the game mechanics worked as intended, work relied heavily on console logs to output what was happening under the hood.
![Console Outputs](readme-images/console.webp)
### Look and Feel
To add visual feedback to the game, animations were created with tabletop cards in mind, but also how battles in old RPG's work. With this in mind and to save screen real estate, the card-flip animation was created, this creates a natural space where the d20 roll animation could be shown to the player. The damage animation was created to make the attack animation feel like it has impact. 

The visual theme of the cards continues in the theme of old-school RPGs where the graphical assets are pixelated and the reason why the retro-styled fonts (DotGothic16 and VT323) were selected.

To address the visual monotony that a one-color background might present, especially on larger screens, a play board-styled background image was added. The card frames and buttons are custom-designed to match the aesthetic of the background.

#### Color codes
Colors were selected using coolors.co, matching them with the main colors of the background image and the play board.
Monsters have a unique background color to difference them more than just their graphic image.

### Bugs
<details><summary>Bug: No new monster is picked after the player defeats the current one</summary>

This was fixed by creating a function to make a copy of the randomly selected monster.
```js
currentMonster = copyMonster(selectRandomMonster());
/**
* Copies the stats from a monster in the monster array
* @param {*} monster
* @returns
*/
function copyMonster(monster) {
return Object.assign({}, monster);
}
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: The player can make multiple attacks in one turn by pressing the attack button twice</summary>

The EventListener for the attack button was in the `gameLoop()` function, but the EventListener was never disabled, making it possible to press the button in quick succession to run the `playerTurn()` function multiple times.
To fix this I moved the EventListener from the `gameLoop()`:
```js
if (isPlayerTurn) {
	 // It's the player's turn
	 // Wait for the player to take it's action
	 let playerActionBtn = document.getElementById('attack');
	 playerActionBtn.addEventListener('click', playerTurn);
	 }
```
To the `playerTurn()`function, where the EventListener is removed when the user presses the button
```js
async function playerTurn() {
	 // Prevent the button to be pressed several times
	 function onPlayerActionClick() {
		 playerActionBtn.removeEventListener('click', onPlayerActionClick);
		 playerAttack();
	 }
	 // Listener for attack button
	 let playerActionBtn = document.getElementById('attack');
	 playerActionBtn.addEventListener('click', onPlayerActionClick);
 }
 The old `playerTurn()`function was renamed to `PlayerAttack()`
```

</details>
<details> <summary>Bug: Damage rolls are higher than intended</summary>

In the `rollForDamage()`function, the number of hit dices are looped to ensure the case where more than 1 hit dice is used. However, there was a typo that caused the loop to roll 1 extra dice.
```js
for (let i=0; i <= creature.numDices; i++) {
		 damage += creature.hitDice + creature.plusDmg;
	 }
```
This was fixed by fixes the typo.
```js
  for (let i=0; i < creature.numDices; i++) {
		 damage += creature.hitDice + creature.plusDmg;
	 }
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Monsters damage is miscalculated</summary>

There was a typo in the `monsterTurn()`function.
This added the players toHit value to the monsters attack.
```js
let attackRoll = diceRoll + player.toHit;
```
This was fixed with:
```js
let attackRoll = diceRoll + currentMonster.toHit;
```

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Damage is not calculated correctly</summary>

This bug was caused when I tried to clean up the code.
In commit `7330400` I changed the hitDice value in both the player and monster array from:
```js
const player = {
	...
	hitDice: d10,
	...
}
const monsters = {
	...
	hitDice: d6,
	...
	hitDice: d12,
}
function rollForDamage(creature, crit) {
	...
	damage += creature.hitDice() + creature.plusDmg;
	...
}
```
to:
```js
const player = {
	...
	hitDice: d10(),
	...
}
const monsters = {
	...
	hitDice: d6(),
	...
	hitDice: d12(),
}
function rollForDamage(creature, crit) {
	...
	damage += creature.hitDice + creature.plusDmg;
	...
}
```
This caused the hitdice functions to be run only once at the start of the game and not be a random number for each roll as intended. The solution was to revert the changes.

</details>
<details><summary>Bug: Start button could not be pressed in Safari</summary>

This bug only occured in MacOS Safari, the original plan was to have the Start button flip together with the player card, like it was a part of it. However in testing I realised that only one half of the button was clickable. This has something with how Safari interperrets the `transform-style: preserve-3d;` in CSS, I could not fix it without moving the Start button from the player-card div to the btn-area div (where it logically belongs). However after that I struggled with getting the button flip animation to work smoothly with the card, I eventually settled with creating a fade animation for the button.
```css
.button-fade {
	animation: buttonFade ease 1s;
}
@keyframes buttonFade {
	0% { opacity: 0; }
	100% { opacity: 1; }
}
```
